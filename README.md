# ann

The goal of this library is to provide a compact, light-weight, portable library
of primitives that can be used for training and evaluating Neural Networks.

There are two main components to the library. The first is a lightweight Tensor library, `tensor.c`. The second is a minimal training and inference runtime, 
`ann.c`.

>The tensor library is not meant to be a comprehensive library. It provides only
> the functions needed to support the inference runtime.
